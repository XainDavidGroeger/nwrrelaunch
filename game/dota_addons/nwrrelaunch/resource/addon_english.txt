This hero favors longer more drawn out confrontations meaning that survivability is of top priority. His abilities offer him great utility in almost any situation whether it be ganking, team fighting, or taking on an enemy one on one. Kisame is very mana dependant as his ultimate consumes mana over time. His passive somewhat remedies this problem as his attacks will drain mana from enemies while gaining the stolen mana. However, this mechanic can be deceptive to Kisame’s mana problems as a larger max mana pool requires more mana to sustain his ultimate. This means that his mana drain is more effective the smaller Kisame’s max mana pool is.  Kisame can easily dominate a team fight so long as he can stick onto various heroes. Through proper micro of his clones and intelligent maneuvering, Kisame is a walking pain train that forces the fight onto the enemy."
